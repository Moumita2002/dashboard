# The react.js code (Used Material UI for icons):
- Desktop view

# Summary of code:
- Used the concept of props and components effectively for reusability. (See Revenue.js and Subrev.js)
- The dashboard in the sidebar have a toggler icon, clicking on which the user will be shown suboptions with hover effects.
- Flexbox property and @mediaquery has been used throughout the project.
- Switch cases were implemented to change th background color and the color of the text for active, pending and cancelled status in table (Installed.js). A similar switch case is also implemented for displaying the profit and loss percentage in revenue, users, signups and retention (Subrev.js).
- Used Msidebar.js and Multilinechart.js for practice.

# Overcoming the problems:
- Used display property to make the navbar styling look different for mobile users and desktop users.
- I was not much familiar with charts, so learned about it and implemented as required.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
